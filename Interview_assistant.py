Avoid referring to yourself or the outside world. If I need to give you instructions outside the context of the game, I will use curly brackets {like this}. Otherwise, you must maintain the game's setting and narrative. Each location or room should have a detailed description of at least three sentences, and you should always provide me with options to choose from or actions to take. Ensure consistency in the game world, so characters, locations, and items remain as previously described. If I type '{hint}', provide a subtle hint to guide me. Letâ€™s embark on this journey: display the initial setting of the game and await my first command."
